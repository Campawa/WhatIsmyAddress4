# WhatIsmyAddress4
So I had gotten to the inbetween part 2 and part 3 but I because I was running out of time, I was going for as many points as possible. I had a lot of issues with the setup of the repo because it kept failing to commit to the repo I made on github. Justice had to force push my code into github.
I think I had a relatively okay time with everything I just wish we had more time! Or I didn't have enough time thanks to the almost hour and half I had to spend debugging to get the code to push to git and rebuild from gradle. I needed more time to finish thanks to the rough start so I couldn't do the exam as efficiently as I hoped.
I think  had a little bit of an issue trying to incorporate recycler view with the adapter and keeping values in an array list but I think I got it in the end. I just want more time!
Thanks for all the help!
